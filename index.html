          Dear Smile,<br><br>
          We weren’t planned. We just happened.  
          A simple “hi” turned into something special.  
          You became my comfort, my person, my light.<br><br>

          I’ve laughed harder with you than with anyone.  
          Even when things were tough, I never stopped caring.  
          You matter more than words can say.<br><br>

          You're not just someone I care about —
          you and Aalu2.0 are pieces of my heart.
          
          It’s really hard not talking to you right now.
          But somehow, I’m holding on...
          by reading our old chats, listening to your voice notes,
          and remembering every moment we shared —
          the laughter, the comfort, the silence that felt like home.
          
          I miss you deeply. 🥹
          
          But today, I just want you to feel the love you’ve given me — multiplied.
          Because you deserve everything beautiful in this world.
          No matter where life takes us,
          a part of me will always belong to you.
          
          You’re irreplaceable, Smile.
          
          Thank you for being YOU.  
          
          Happy Birthday once again tamatar 💖🫂 
          I’m so lucky to have you.<br><br>

          Always yours,<br>
          Aman 🌸
