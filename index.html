          Dear Smile,<br><br>
          We weren’t planned. We just happened.  
          A simple “hi” turned into something special.  
          You became my comfort, my person, my light.<br><br>

          I’ve laughed harder with you than with anyone.  
          Even when things were tough, I never stopped caring.  
          You matter more than words can say.<br><br>

          Thank you for being YOU.  
          Happy Birthday once again.  
          I’m so lucky to know you.<br><br>

          Always yours,<br>
          Aman 🌸
